		<p>The crowd swelled with excitement<br />
		Waiting for their newly anointed one<br />
		Who enters into the Temple of the heart<br />
		We opened the gates<br />
		For our victor to enter<br />
		To welcome this the Savior-soldier<br />
		The warrior-king<br />
		The one who will liberate us from oppression and cruelty<br />
		They yelled from the top of their lungs<br />
		“Hosanna – Save Us!”<br />
		From the enemies that threaten to devour us<br />
		“Save Us!”<br />
		From ourselves<br />
		Lifting our palms to the air in celebration</p>
		
		<p>I cried out from the crowds that day,<br />
		One voice in a sea of people<br />
		One among many who carpeted the ground<br />
		With coats and palms<br />
		With hopes and dreams<br />
		For something better in this world<br />
		To make of it what I will<br />
		I placed a my passions<br />
		Upon this teacher,<br />
		The Master<br />
		Of bread and fishes<br />
		Of the deaf and blind<br />
		Of miracles and spectacles<br />
		But he was on a donkey<br />
		Not a noble steed<br />
		Who was brought down low<br />
		Self-giving<br />
		Seeking to rescue the outsider<br />
		To save us from our sins<br />
		“Who is this?” we questioned<br />
		“Then who are we?” we replied<br />
		Were we disciples following him<br />
		On this inglorious, triumphal road</p>
		
		<p>They did not turn an ear to him<br />
		But made of their hearts a stone<br />
		And rejected him<br />
		Broke him over the rock<br />
		Of all their hopes and fears<br />
		Trampled palms<br />
		Scattered ashes</p>

		<h2 id="questions-for-reflection">Questions for Reflection</h2>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Putting yourself as a spectator to Jesus’s triumphal entry, from what would you seek liberation? What might be your expectation from this mighty “warrior-king”?</li>
			
			<li>How have we “carpeted the ground” with our expectations of God and what God would do for us?</li>
			
			<li>What might it mean for this warrior to ride on a donkey instead of a “noble steed”?</li>
			
			<li>How have we, as humanity, broken Jesus “over the rock?” In what ways have we rejected Jesus’s true identity?</li>
			
			<li>The last two verses reflect on how the “trampled palms” turned into the “ashes” of “Ash Wednesday.” What might this mean?</li>
			</ol>

		<p>The “Triumphal Entry” was Jesus’s entrance into Jerusalem and into the Temple. The kings of Israel, such as David, rode into town this way, especially after a successful war campaign. However, Jesus transforms this image and rides in on a donkey, a beast of burden. He is not “king” and “warrior” in the ways that they expected him to be. He would not lead a rebellion to overthrow the Roman Empire, as the Maccabees did against the Greeks. He would not rule on a kingly throne with scepter and sword. Instead he sought to conquer and rule the hearts of his people. This was the mission of Jesus’s new Kingdom.</p>
		
		<p>However, the crowds could not comprehend this. They prayed for a Messiah like David and they received a teacher of non-violence. Instead of “strike down your enemies,” Jesus preached to “love our enemies.” The view of the “Kingdom of God” was not as many people expected it. Jesus had trampled on their dreams of political liberation and violent rebellion. Soon the cheer of “save us” would turn to shouts of “crucify him.” This was not the hope they were after and a price had to be paid for their disappointment.</p>
		
		<p>What form would God’s deliverance and justice take? Like the time of wilderness wandering after their exodus from Egypt, God sought to conquer and rule the hearts of God’s people. The forty years in the dessert was to show them how to live in community with each other and with God. The Hebrew people were taught how to live in a world of abundance and flourishing. However, many years later, the Roman Empire reversed this training. Again, people sought their own kind of rule, their own source of provision. Many of them sought a king, a messiah, who would save them from oppression. Others, like the Sadducees, sought to maintain the power of the status quo. Still others, like the Essenes, retreated from the world to hope for their own “Teacher of Righteousness.”</p>
		
		<p>It seems like today, Christians are left with those same options: to rebel against the world, to retreat from the world, to adopt the world’s system. Is there another option for the church? How might we respond to a Jesus who failed to live up to our expectations? On what are we placing our hopes and dreams? What “palms” do we need to lay down at Jesus’s feet? How can we allow Jesus to be the kind of king he came to be?</p>
		
		<p>As Lent comes to a close, we have made it from the desert to Jerusalem, the great city of David. Here is where Jesus will face his worst trials. The wilderness was only a foretaste of what is to come. The shadow of the cross looms in the distance and on that hill is where this journey will take him. This is where God’s own dream is taken to be shattered on the hard hearts of humanity. May we be able to meet Jesus there.</p>
