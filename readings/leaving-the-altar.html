		<p>There is heartbreak in the letting go<br />
		Turning our face from the place of our birth<br />
		But not wanting to forsake life in Eden<br />
		For a land stained with blood<br />
		Haunted by the cries from a field<br />
		Where we’ve done violence to ourselves and to another<br />
		We wandered so far from that country of origin<br />
		Marking ourselves with a burden<br />
		Yet protected and provided<br />
		Repeating in a mantra:<br />
		Even though I walk through the deepest, darkest valley, <br />
		I fear no evil</p>
		
		<p>When we cannot look any deeper<br />
		When there is none who can peer into the inner parts<br />
		The depths where we dare not go Our hearts are anointed,<br />
		And preserved<br />
		To not be of want<br />
		To eat from the fruit of light<br />
		And not from darkness<br />
		But to walk again on paths of righteousness</p>
		
		<p>I have brought sacrifices to the altar<br />
		And often I have held on to the very things I desired to give up<br />
		Clutching even to pain<br />
		Because I have nothing else to hold Giving up is a giving up of my image<br />
		Something too great to ask<br />
		Keeping my feet stuck to this ground Blinding me from what is ahead</p>
		
		<p>When I thought my eyes were opened Claiming to see</p>
