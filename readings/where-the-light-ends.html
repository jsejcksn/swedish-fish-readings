		<p>Clouds collide<br />
		To come together<br />
		Turning soft white into a dingy black<br />
		To walk up the hill to the place of the skull<br />
		Following soldiers<br />
		And mockers<br />
		And someone who carried a cross<br />
		For one unable to carry his own</p>
		
		<p>He was left to our own devices<br />
		To do with him as we wished<br />
		To tear him apart<br />
		Clothes of a king<br />
		Scraps of humanity scattered to the wind<br />
		Bits of flesh off the back<br />
		On this dark and dirty day<br />
		Painted in bruised purple<br />
		Surely God had forsaken him<br />
		Left him here<br />
		Cast out of the womb<br />
		From the warm garden of birth<br />
		Taken from the mother’s breast<br />
		And given to this humanity<br />
		He no longer belonged to us, and we are no longer his<br />
		To a mother he said, “this is your son”<br />
		And to a son, “this is your mother”<br />
		At this point, each had went their own way</p>
		
		<p>In this place I stood up<br />
		In the shadow of these figures<br />
		Pressed against the sky<br />
		Paper men cut out by scissors<br />
		I saw myself as them<br />
		In all the moments of rejection<br />
		As stones thrown out from the quarry<br />
		Polished in the pain and suffering<br />
		Where my own cross was too heavy to carry<br />
		And the weight of my regret and loss pressed heavy on my chest<br />
		The anxiety of wanting to make something more of myself<br />
		Was almost too much to bear<br />
		All my work was of waste<br />
		All my dreams nailed up on a tree</p>
		
		<p>But it was too much for this crucified king<br />
		Who was made a victim for all our crimes<br />
		A voice for a suffering<br />
		We emptied our guilt upon him<br />
		We made him a burden for our shame<br />
		Because we could not bare to take the blame<br />
		Because we rejected God’s gift of goodness</p>
		
		<p>Looking up, Jesus cried out to God<br />
		To hear only deafening silence<br />
		Bashed and bloodied<br />
		But bones not broken<br />
		He spoke his final words<br />
		“It is finished,”<br />
		completed<br />
		It was all he could do for us<br />
		To pour out himself for people who made a mockery of his life<br />
		He hung his head</p>
		
		<hr class="poetic-break" />
		
		<p>Entering into the tomb<br />
		Where the light ends and the nothingness begins<br />
		No longer in the land of the living<br />
		But another entrance<br />
		To be sealed shut,<br />
		East of the Eden</p>

		<h2 id="questions-for-reflection">Questions for Reflection</h2>
		
		<ol>
			<li>What might it mean that Jesus was “one unable to carry his own [cross]”? What does this say about who he was?</li>
			
			<li>How is tearing Jesus apart actually tearing humanity apart as in the verse, “Scraps of humanity scattered to the wind”?</li>
			
			<li>“Each had went their own way” is a reference to the disciples (mainly male disciples) leaving Jesus to die at the cross. In what ways have we abandoned God and sought our own way?</li>
			
			<li>Experiences of death and suffering often <em>appear</em> to be experiences of God’s abandonment. Often the biblical writers would describe the crucifixion in the language of forsakenness. In what way did God “abandon” Jesus? In what way did God not abandon Jesus?</li>
			
			<li>Jesus was the rejected stone, “thrown out from the quarry.” How might we identify with this experience of rejection?</li>
			
			<li>How might “this crucified king” be “made a victim for all our crimes”? How was Jesus made a scapegoat, someone to blame for the problems of his society?</li>
			
			<li>In the last stanza, “east of Eden” is a reference to the Garden and the lost of home. How is death a “lost of home”? Who “drove” Jesus out of the garden? </li>
			</ol>

		<p>“Good Friday” is not described as “good” because the world put an innocent person to death, nor is it good because God’s beautiful gift of life was violently beaten and crucified. It was “good” because out of the wreckage that was the crucifixion, God was able to bring life. Good Friday was not good because of the death of God. Nietzsche announced that “God is dead” as an accusation of the modern world. Good Friday was good that in this death, God could show us God’s love. This is the humble and solemn celebration of Good Friday.</p>
		
		<p>Sometimes Christians are too quick to say something to the effect “God can make something good out of evil.” This is true, but it should not be a justification of the evil that many people do in this world. The cross was not to condone evil and injustice; it was to condemn them. The year 2015 marks the seventieth year after the victims of the Holocaust were free from the death camps at Auschwitz. This violent part of our human history is not something that we celebrate but memorialize. It is a reminder never to be a part of this kind of violence, no matter how often history seems to repeat itself. In the same way we are reminded not to kill those who God has sent to us. God’s only Son was the victim of the violence of humanity, but God’s love was triumphant even in our hatred.</p>
		
		<p>In what ways have we rejected God’s love? In what ways have we abandoned the one who always pursued us, who never left us? The world killed its Savior because it feared what this love might do. Great love has a way of disrupting the status quo, throwing off the balance of power, persuading the hearts and minds of people. Great love is always a threat to those frightened and insecure. It is a threat because of the fear that it might change the world, or more importantly, it might change them. How might we embrace this beautiful gift that is making its way into our lives?</p>
