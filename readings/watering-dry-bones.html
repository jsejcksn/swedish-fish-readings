		<p>I was brought to the foot of the dry, dry valley—<br />
		A parched soul.</p>
		
		<p>Looking up at me were the desolation of bodies<br />
		Poured out before me<br />
		I looked down to see myself in their fallen flesh<br />
		And I was asked to speak truth to power<br />
		Against death and disease<br />
		Against my anxieties and vexations<br />
		Pulling my body apart<br />
		To keep from dragging me into the grave<br />
		Again, I was asked to speak against all that brings me to decay<br />
		Wrapped in lifeless pursuits and projects<br />
		So I am built up from bones to flesh,<br />
		As the Son of Man<br />
		And flesh to breath<br />
		And from breath to life<br />
		God’s life<br />
		The Spirit drenching my thirst</p>
		
		<p>And in looking down,<br />
		I found myself looking back up<br />
		From the depths<br />
		The familiar dark places<br />
		Where I find myself<br />
		Over and over again<br />
		Drinking from the fountain of darkness<br />
		Hoping for the light of morning<br />
		To open my eyes to something more than darkness<br />
		Invisible Spirit,<br />
		Life waking in me<br />
		So to breathe<br />
		At times I attempt to take in the air<br />
		And at times it hurts to just hope<br />
		For my fallen dreams<br />
		Do not rise easily<br />
		Disappointment trembling in a pile of feathers<br />
		Trying to find a pulse</p>
		
		<p>Lazarus knew death<br />
		The intimacy of separation<br />
		Of losing parts of one’s self<br />
		Living in the land, alone to our devices<br />
		Watering the cracked clay<br />
		with tears mixed with longing<br />
		He heard a voice calling<br />
		To the tomb and the shroud<br />
		A voice pulled his heart<br />
		Waking him from his desolate dreams<br />
		A voice yet to know the depths of this pain<br />
		This experience still foreign to him<br />
		But the Master still calls,<br />
		And Lazarus still hears</p>
		
		<p>Outside the grave<br />
		Jesus was weeping,<br />
		Not for Lazarus<br />
		But for our not being able to see<br />
		The place outside the grave<br />
		Unable to know the love that is present<br />
		The life that is before us,<br />
		In flesh and blood<br />
		Our eyes, unwrapped.</p>

		<h2 id="questions-for-reflection">Questions for Reflection</h2>
		
		<ol>
			<li>What would it be like to be given life to our “dry bones”?</li>
			
			<li>What are the things in your life that are pulling you apart or under “decay”?</li>
			
			<li>What “fallen dreams” might you have that do not “rise easily”? In this poem, death is described as “The intimacy of separation / Of losing parts of one’s self”? What might this mean? How is death more than just the end of physical life?</li>
			
			<li>How might Jesus call us from our “desolate dreams”? What might this voice sound like for you?</li>
			
			<li>The last stanza is a retelling of the raising of Lazarus in the Gospel of John. What might it mean to say, “Jesus was weeping, / Not for Lazarus / But for our not being able to see”? How might our eyes still be “wrapped” in burial cloth and not see “the life that is before us”?</li>
			</ol>

		<p>Death does not only come at the end of our lives, it eats away at us each day. Paul would write, “For the wages of sin is death...”<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup> In a time of day-worker economics, Paul describes death as something that is paid out daily. It did not only come when our physical bodies died. We experience death each day when we move out of relationship with others and with God. However, the other part of that verse is “but the gift of God is life eternal, in Christ Jesus our Lord.” If death is paid each day for sin, then life is given freely each day by God. The word “eternal life” is a unique word in Greek because joined with the word “life” the adjective “eternal” does not mean “everlasting” as in a quantity of life, but it describes a quality of life. Eternal life is not duration of life. In horror fiction, vampires have “eternal” life, but they are actually dead. Eternal life is about a kind of life that is lived in the present, not after someone dies.</p>
		
		<p>The Bible describes the Spirit of God as life, wind, and breath. The Spirit breathes into the dead bones. It is what provides the animating principle to our lives. Life lived connected to the Spirit of God is a life that is always drawing on the Source of life. In Greek, the word for life (<em>zoe</em>) is distinguished by physical breath (<em>psuche</em>).<sup><a href="#note-2">2</a></sup> In other words, in our modern world, breathing is an indicator of life. However, this is not what it means to live. Living is more than respiration. It is a connection to the Source of all living things, the Spirit of God.</p>
		
		<p>To continue my horror movie theme, the idea of the zombie was actually a commentary on modern American life. A zombie is an animated, “undead” thing. It movies around, feet shuffling, hands flailing, constantly hungry, but it is not alive. Many of us live as “zombies,” with little purpose in life but to consume things. How might we live fully as the people in whom we were made to be? Perhaps a place to start is to realize places in our lives that reek of death and allow God’s Spirit to breathe life back to those places. However, this is a messy process in which some of us would rather not engage. Even for Lazarus, being raised from the dead also meant having his family and friends unbind him from his burial wrappings. We may need to also need the help of others, so we might enter back into “the land of the living.”</p>

		<ol>
			<li id="note-1">Romans 6:23</li>
			<li id="note-2"><em>Psyche</em> also has the sense of “human soul”; however, the sense is of human animating principle. Despite some recent views of Greek philosophy, not all Greek thought sought to divide body from soul.</li>
